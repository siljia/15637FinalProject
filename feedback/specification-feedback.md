Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 

### The product backlog (10/10)
Team members must participate in all sprints. You cannot have one student work on one sprint and not on others. This is not a good way to collaborate.
All users do not need to agree for a game to end. Users should be able to quit a game or leave the room when a game is in process.

### Data models (10/10)
You did not include a model to store the state of a game. It'll be useful for reconnecting users.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

### Additional Information
